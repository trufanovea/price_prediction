Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

In this tutorial, we will explore the process of predicting house prices using Python. We will utilize the popular libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The dataset we will be working with contains information about house locations, prices, square footage, and other relevant features. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict house prices based on these variables, using Linear Regression.

Before delving into the modeling process, it is crucial to understand the dataset thoroughly. We begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. By examining the dataset's head and using the describe function, we gain insights into the data's structure and statistical properties.

Next, we move on to visualizations, which help us understand various aspects of the dataset. We start by determining the most common number of bedrooms in houses. This information can be valuable for builders, as it allows them to identify the preferred house types and make informed decisions. Additionally, we explore the geographical distribution of houses using latitude and longitude coordinates, revealing concentrations of house locations in certain areas.

To uncover factors that influence house prices, we analyze relationships between price and other variables. For instance, we examine the correlation between price and square footage, as well as the impact of waterfront properties, number of floors, and overall condition on house prices. These visualizations provide insights into how different factors contribute to price fluctuations.

Having gained insights from the dataset, we proceed to build our prediction model using Linear Regression. We split the data into training and testing sets, with the former used to train the model and the latter for evaluation. The accuracy score of our initial Linear Regression model is calculated, indicating its predictive performance. However, if the accuracy falls short of our desired threshold, we can explore alternative methods, such as Gradient Boosting.

Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that combines weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a more accurate ensemble model. By employing Gradient Boosting Regression, we aim to enhance the prediction accuracy of our model. We import the necessary libraries, set the parameters for the Gradient Boosting Regressor, fit the training data, and assess the accuracy of the model. In this case, we achieve an accuracy score of 91.94%, surpassing our initial goal.

In conclusion, this tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on predicting house prices using Python. By employing Linear Regression and exploring Gradient Boosting, we demonstrate how to create accurate models for price prediction based on various house features.
